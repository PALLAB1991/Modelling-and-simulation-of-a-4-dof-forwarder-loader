# Modelling-and-simulation-of-a-4-dof-forwarder-loader
The aim of this exercise is to build a simulation model of a 4 - actuator degree-of-freedom (DOF) hydraulic loader and to simulate it in real-time computer. This simulation model shall take into account the dynamics of the multi-body mechanical system as well as the dynamics (fluid compressibility, pressure generation) of the oil hydraulic system powering the loader.
This report is divided into four main parts as they are General Description, Modelling, Implementation and Testing and Future Development.
